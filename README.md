# GroceryStoreApp
This is a console application for a grocery store. I made it with Java using the Eclipse IDE, but you can run it in any IDE that supports Java. If you use another IDE, then all you need to do is copy and paste the java files in the src/GroceryStore folder into your folder and delete the first line in each java file (which specifies the package). Then you can run it using the console. 

There are 3 classes in this application:

1. Employee.java: This class is used to define an employee that works in the grocery store. 
2. Item.java: This class is used to define an item in the grocery store. 
3. MainClass.java: This class contains the main method and the methods to add items, remove items, add employees, remove employees, print sales reports and many more.

How to use the app?

When you run this application, you are presented with a menu that shows the options Items, Employees, Cashier, Reports and Exit. By selecting the Items option, you are then presented with another menu that shows different things you can do related to items, such as adding, updating or searching for an item. By selecting the Employees option, you are then presented with another menu that shows different things you can do related to employees, such as adding, updating or searching for an item. By selecting the Cashier option, you can choose items that you want to buy from the store and have a receipt printed for you at the end. By selecting the Reports option, you are presented with another menu from which you choose which type of report you want to print. Finally, the Exit option is used to exit the application.
